# PAN, LAN, MAN, WAN

## PAN

- Personal Area Network

**Advantages**

- Allows for easy communication between personal devices in close proximity
- Can be set up easily and quickly
- Uses wireless technology, which eliminates the need for wires

**Disadvantages**

- Limited range
- Not suitable for large-scale data transfer
- May experience interference from other devices

**Examples**

- Bluetooth
- USB

## LAN

- Local Area Network

**Advantages**

- fast data transfer rates and high speed communication
- easy to set up and maintain
- Provides increased security compared to WAN

**Disadvantages**

- Limited to a small geographical area
- Limited scalability and may require significant infrastructure to accommodate growth
- May experience **congestion** and network performance issues with increased usage

**congestion**: the state of being overcrowded, especially with **excessive** **mass** or **traffic**

**Examples**

- Home network

## MAN

- Metropolitan Area Network

**Advantages**

- Provides high-speed connectivity over a larger geographical area than LAN
- Can be used as an **ISP** for multiple customers
- offers higher data transfer rates than WAN in some cases

**Disadvantages**

- May have limited security compared to LAN
- May experience congestion and network performance issues with increased usage
- Can be expensive to set up and maintain

**ISP**: Internet Service Provider

**Examples**

- City-wide network

## WAN

- Wide Area Network

**Advantages**

- Covers large geographical areas and can connect remote locations
- Provides connectivity to the internet
- offers remote access to resources and applications

**Disadvantages**

- Can be expensive to set up and maintain
- offers slower data transfer compared to LAN and MAN
- Have lower security compared to LANs

**Examples**

- Internet

# Dynamic vs Static Web Pages

## Static Web Pages

- web pages are returned by the server which are prebuilt source code files built using simple languages such as HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.

- web pages are returned by the serverwith no change therefore, static websites are fast.

- there is no interaction with databases. also, they are less costly as the host does not need to support server-side processing with different languages.

## Dynamic Web Pages

- Web pages are returned by the server which is processed during runtime means they are not prebuilt web pages, but they are built during runtime according to the userâ€™s demand with the help of server-side scripting languages such as PHP, Node.js, ASP.NET and many more supported by the server.

# Direct vs Indirect access to the Internet

## Indirect Access

- This is the most common method used in home and office networks
- The user's computer is connected to a router, which is connected to a modem, which is connected to the ISP

## Direct Access

- This is the most common method used when traveling
- The device is connected directly to the ISP's network via a wireless connection, 3G, 4G, or 5G

# Software vs Hardware

## Software

**Definition:** Software is a program or set of instructions which are to be executed by The CPU to do the intended task.

**Tangibility:** Software is intangible.

**Categories:** Programming Software, Application Software, Operating Systems.

**Digital Transfer:** Software can be transferred electronically.

**Replacement:** If software get damaged, it is reinstalled.

**Programming:** Software can be developed in machine language, assembly language, or high-level language.

**Examples:** Microsoft Word, Adobe Photoshop, etc.

## Hardware

**Definition:** Hardware is a set of physical parts of computers which actually executes the instructions.

**Tangibility:** Hardware is tangible.

**Categories:** Input Devices, Output Devices, Storage Devices, Internal Components of CPU and motherboard.

**Digital Transfer:** Hardware can be only physically transferred.

**Replacement:** If hardware gets damaged, it is replaced.

**Programming:** Hardware understands only machine language.

**Examples:** Keyboard, Mouse, Monitor, etc.
