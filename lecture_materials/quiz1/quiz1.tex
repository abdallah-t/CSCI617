\section*{Question 1}
Name 2 operating systems that are used in mobile phones.
\begin{itemize}[label=\alph*.]
    \item Android
    \item iOS
\end{itemize}

\section*{Question 2}
Explain the difference between volatile and non-volatile memory.
\begin{itemize}[label=\alph*.]
    \item Volatile memory is a type of memory that loses its content when the power is turned off, while non-volatile memory is a type of memory that retains its content when the power is turned off.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Question 3}
True or False: Secondary memory is more expensive than primary memory.
\begin{itemize}[label=\alph*.]
    \item False
\end{itemize}

\section*{Question 4}
True or False: A computer system cannot run without secondary memory.
\begin{itemize}[label=\alph*.]
    \item False
\end{itemize}

\section*{Question 5}
Complete the sentence: In digital transfer, hardware can be only
\begin{itemize}[label=\alph*.]
    \item Physically transferred.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Question 6}
Advantages of cache memory are:
\begin{itemize}[label=\alph*.]
    \item It is faster than the main memory. When compared to the main memory, it takes less time to access it. It keeps the programs that can be run in a short amount of time, and it stores data for temporary use.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Question 7}
True or False: Case cooling uses an air cooling system to remove heat from inside the case of the system.
\begin{itemize}[label=\alph*.]
    \item True
\end{itemize}

\section*{Question 8}
True or False: Between the CPU and the main memory, cache memory serves as a buffer.
\begin{itemize}[label=\alph*.]
    \item True
\end{itemize}

\section*{Question 9}
Disadvantages of cache memory are:
\begin{itemize}[label=\alph*.]
    \item It is very expensive because of the semiconductors used in it.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Question 10}
True or False: Hardware can be seen and touched.
\begin{itemize}[label=\alph*.]
    \item True
\end{itemize}

\section*{Question 11}
True or False: A computer is an electrical device used to process and store data for further use. It can save information, retrieve it, and process it.
\begin{itemize}[label=\alph*.]
    \item True
\end{itemize}

\section*{Question 12}
For the CPU to access data from the auxiliary memory, it should:
\begin{itemize}[label=\alph*.]
    \item Be transferred to the main memory.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Question 13}
How to erase data in EPROM?
\begin{itemize}[label=\alph*.]
    \item By exposing it to ultraviolet light.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Question 14}
With expansion cards, you can make your computer:
\begin{itemize}[label=\alph*.]
    \item More powerful, add more memory, add more ports.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Question 15}
(Question 15 is empty)

\section*{Question 16}
True or False: A CPU cannot access secondary memory directly.
\begin{itemize}[label=\alph*.]
    \item True
\end{itemize}

\section*{Question 17}
True or False: One disadvantage of liquid cooling is that it doesn't make any noise and is very quiet.
\begin{itemize}[label=\alph*.]
    \item False
\end{itemize}

\section*{Question 18}
True or False: The storage capacity of secondary memory is small.
\begin{itemize}[label=\alph*.]
    \item False
\end{itemize}

\section*{Question 19}
True or False: In replacement, if software got damaged, it can be reinstalled.
\begin{itemize}[label=\alph*.]
    \item True
\end{itemize}

\section*{Question 20}
Pros of MAC are:
\begin{itemize}[label=\alph*.]
    \item Stability and reliability.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Question 21}
Secondary memory is:
\begin{itemize}[label=\alph*.]
    \item Auxiliary memory and backup memory and non-volatile memory.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Question 22}
How many 128x8 memory chips are required to provide a memory capacity of 4096x16?
\begin{itemize}[label=\alph*.]
    \item 64
\end{itemize}

\section*{Question 23}
True or False: Hardware consists of a set of instructions to be executed by the CPU to perform the intended task.
\begin{itemize}[label=\alph*.]
    \item False
\end{itemize}

\section*{Question 24}
True or False: Input Devices, Output Devices, Storage Devices, Internal components of the CPU, and the motherboard are categorized under software.
\begin{itemize}[label=\alph*.]
    \item False
\end{itemize}

\section*{Question 25}
True or False: Cache Memory is used to store the data and programs that the CPU uses most frequently.
\begin{itemize}[label=\alph*.]
    \item True
\end{itemize}

\section*{Question 26}
Name the advantages of cache memory.
\begin{itemize}[label=\alph*.]
    \item It is faster than the main memory. When compared to the main memory, it takes less time to access. It keeps the programs that can be run in a short amount of time, and it stores data for temporary use.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Question 27}
Why do computers use cooling systems?
\begin{itemize}[label=\alph*.]
    \item To prevent overheating.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Question 28}
What is computer memory?
\begin{itemize}[label=\alph*.]
