**Question 1:** Name 2 operating systems that are used in mobile phones.

- Android
- iOS

**Question 2:** Explain the difference between volatile and non-volatile memory.

- Volatile memory is a type of memory that loses its content when the power is turned off, while non-volatile memory is a type of memory that retains its content when the power is turned off.

**Question 3:** True or False: Secondary memory is more expensive than primary memory.

- False

**Question 4:** True or False: A computer system cannot run without secondary memory.

- False

**Question 5:** Complete the sentence: In digital transfer, hardware can be only

- Physically transferred.

**Question 6:** Advantages of cache memory are:

a. It can only read the programs and data that are stored in it.

b. It is faster than the main memory.

c. It is faster than the main memory. When compared to the main memory, it takes less time to access it. It keeps the programs that can be run in a short amount of time, and it stores data for temporary use.

d. It keeps the programs that can be run in a short amount of time. When compared to the main memory, it takes less time to access it.

- c. It is faster than the main memory. When compared to the main memory, it takes less time to access it. It keeps the programs that can be run in a short amount of time, and it stores data for temporary use.

**Question 7:** True or False: Case cooling uses an air cooling system to remove heat from inside the case of the system.

- True

**Question 8:** True or False: Between the CPU and the main memory, cache memory serves as a buffer.

- True

**Question 9:** Disadvantages of cache memory are:

a. The size of the cache (the amount of data it can store) is usually large.

b. It is faster than the main memory.

c. It stores data for temporary use.

d. It is very expensive because of the semiconductors used in it.

- d. It is very expensive because of the semiconductors used in it.

**Question 10:** True or False: Hardware can be seen and touched.

- True

**Question 11:** True or False: A computer is an electrical device used to process and store data for further use. It can save information, retrieve it, and process it.

- True

**Question 12:** For the CPU to access data from the auxiliary memory, it should:

a. It can be accessed directly.

b. Be transferred to the cache memory.

c. Be transferred to the main memory.

d. Be transferred to the secondary memory.

- c. Be transferred to the main memory.

**Question 13:** How to erase data in EPROM?

- By exposing it to ultraviolet light.

**Question 14:** With expansion cards, you can make your computer:

a. Change the charger.

b. Harder to fix.

c. More powerful, add more memory, add more ports.

d. A common target of malware.

- c. More powerful, add more memory, add more ports.

**Question 15:** (Question 15 is empty)

**Question 16:** True or False: A CPU cannot access secondary memory directly.

- True

**Question 17:** True or False: One disadvantage of liquid cooling is that it doesn't make any noise and is very quiet.

- False

**Question 18:** True or False: The storage capacity of secondary memory is small.

- False

**Question 19:** True or False: In replacement, if software got damaged, it can be reinstalled.

- True

**Question 20:** Pros of MAC are:

a. Affordability.

b. Hard to fix.

c. High upfront price.

d. Stability and reliability.

- d. Stability and reliability.

**Question 21:** Secondary memory is:

a. Auxiliary memory and backup memory and non-volatile memory.

b. Non-volatile memory only.

c. Auxiliary memory only.

d. Can only read the programs and data that are stored on it.

- a. Auxiliary memory and backup memory and non-volatile memory.

**Question 22:** How many 128x8 memory chips are required to provide a memory capacity of 4096x16?

- 64

**Question 23:** True or False: Hardware consists of a set of instructions to be executed by the CPU to perform the intended task.

- False

**Question 24:** True or False: Input Devices, Output Devices, Storage Devices, Internal components of the CPU, and the motherboard are categorized under software.

- False

**Question 25:** True or False: Cache Memory is used to store the data and programs that the CPU uses most frequently.

- True

**Question 26:** Name the advantages of cache memory.

- It is faster than the main memory. When compared to the main memory, it takes less time to access. It keeps the programs that can be run in a short amount of time, and it stores data for temporary use.

**Question 27:** Why do computers use cooling systems?

- To prevent overheating.

**Question 28:** What is computer memory?

a. Stores information based on the power supply.

b. It is the same as memory in a human brain. It is used to store data and instructions.

c. It is non-volatile memory.

d. It is volatile memory.

- b. It is the same as memory in a human brain. It is used to store data and instructions.
