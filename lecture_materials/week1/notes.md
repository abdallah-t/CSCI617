## What is a Computer?

A computer is an electrical device used to process and store data for further use. It can save information, retrieve it, and process it.

## Hardware vs Software

### Definition

- **Hardware**: the physical components of a computer
- **Software**: the programs that run on a computer

### Tangibility

- **Hardware**: tangible
- **Software**: intangible

### Categories

- **Hardware**: input, output, processing, and storage devices
- **Software**: operating systems, applications, programming software

### Transferring methods

- **Hardware**: can be transferred physically
- **Software**: can be transferred electronically

### Replacement methods

- **Hardware**: can be replaced
- **Software**: can be reinstalled

### Understood programming languages

- **Hardware**: only understands machine language
- **Software**: can be written in any programming language

## Windows Vs Mac

### Windows

**Pros:**

- Affordability
- Hardware flexibility
- Customizability
- Widely available support and software
- More options for compatible accessories
- Easier to repair
- More common

**Cons:**

- Lower resale value
- More prone to viruses
- Some configurations are less stable and/or reliable

### Mac

**Pros:**

- Stability and reliability
- Aesthetic appeal
- User-friendly design
- Potential long-term savings
- Less prone to malware
- Strong resale value
- Seamless integration with other Apple products

**Cons:**

- High upfront price
- Software is less readily available
- Harder to fix


## CPU

- **CPU**: Central Processing Unit, the brain of the computer


### Features of a CPU

- **Speed**: measured in GHz
- **Cores**: the number of cores in a CPU
- **Cache**: the amount of memory in a CPU
- **Bandwidth**: the amount of data that can be transferred in a given time
- **Compatibility**: the ability of a CPU to work with other components
- **Multithreading**: the ability of a CPU to execute multiple threads at the same time

### CPU Sockets

- **CPU Socket**: the part of the motherboard that holds the CPU

**Types:**

- **PGA**: Pin Grid Array
  - used by AMD
  - pins are on the CPU
  - It lowers the cost of the Motherboard
  - pins are easily damaged
  - pins are easily fixed
  - Mobile devices may benefit from pga socket's small size

- **LGA**: Land Grid Array
  - used by Intel
  - pins are on the motherboard
  - It lowers the cost of the CPU
  - reduced electrical leakage
  - capable of having larger surface area
  - safer than PGA


- **BGA**: Ball Grid Array
  - used in mobile devices, game consoles, and other small devices
  
- **ZIF**: Zero Insertion Force


## Types of Computer Cables

- **VGA**: Video Graphics Array
  - has 15 pins divided into 3 rows
  - only carries analog signals

- **DVI**: Digital Visual Interface

- **HDMI**: High Definition Multimedia Interface

- **DisplayPort**: DisplayPort
  - can use more than one monitor

- **USB**: Universal Serial Bus

## Expansion Cards

- **Expansion Card**: a circuit board that can be inserted into an expansion slot to add functionality to a computer

### Types

- **Video Card**: used to connect the computer to a monitor
- **Sound Card**: used to connect the computer to speakers
- **Network Card**: used to connect the computer to a network
- **Modem**: used to connect the computer to the internet
- **TV Tuner**: used to connect the computer to a TV
